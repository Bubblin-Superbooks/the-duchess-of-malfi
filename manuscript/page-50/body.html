A rotten and dead body, we delight
To hide it in rich tissue:  all our fear,
Nay, all our terror, is, lest our physician
Should put us in the ground to be made sweet.â€”
Your wife 's gone to Rome:  you two couple, and get you to
the wells at Lucca to recover your aches.  I have other work on foot.

Is sick a-days, she pukes, her stomach seethes,

The first our spring yields.</p><pre><code> \[Enter ANTONIO and DELIO, talking together apart\]</code></pre><p>DELIO.                        And so long since married?
