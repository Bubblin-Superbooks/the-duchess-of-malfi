And what is 't makes this blessed government
But a most provident council, who dare freely
Inform him the corruption of the times?
Though some o' the court hold it presumption
To instruct princes what they ought to do,
It is a noble duty to inform them

Would be as lecherous, covetous, or proud,
Bloody, or envious, as any man,
If he had means to be so.—Here's the cardinal.</p><pre><code> \[Enter CARDINAL and BOSOLA\]</code></pre><p>BOSOLA.  I do haunt you still.</p><p>CARDINAL.  So.</p><p>BOSOLA.  I have done you better service than to be slighted thus.
Miserable age, where only the reward of doing well is the doing
of it!</p><p>CARDINAL.  You enforce your merit too much.</p></div> </div>
