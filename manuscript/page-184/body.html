But that; and on the sudden a clear light
Presented me a face folded in sorrow.</p><p>DELIO.  Your fancy merely.</p><p>ANTONIO.                    Come, I 'll be out of this ague,
For to live thus is not indeed to live;
It is a mockery and abuse of life.
I will not henceforth save myself by halves;
Lose all, or nothing.</p><p>DELIO.                 Your own virtue save you!

Spread in so sweet a figure may beget
The more compassion.  However, fare you well.
Though in our miseries Fortune have a part,
Yet in our noble sufferings she hath none.
Contempt of pain, that we may call our own.
     Exeunt.</p><pre><code> Scene IV
