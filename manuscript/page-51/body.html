Could carry these words from you, I should wish
You had no breath at all.â€”Now, sir, in your contemplation?
You are studying to become a great wise fellow.</p><p>BOSOLA.  O, sir, the opinion of wisdom is a foul tetter
that runs all over a man's body:  if simplicity direct us to have
no evil, it directs us to a happy being; for the subtlest folly
proceeds from the subtlest wisdom:  let me be simply honest.</p><p>ANTONIO.  I do understand your inside.</p><p>BOSOLA.                                 Do you so?</p><p>ANTONIO.  Because you would not seem to appear to th' world
Puff'd up with your preferment, you continue
This out-of-fashion melancholy:  leave it, leave it.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">BOSOLA.  Give me leave to be honest in any phrase, in any compliment
whatsoever.  Shall I confess myself to you?  I look no higher than
I can reach:  they are the gods</p></div> </div>
