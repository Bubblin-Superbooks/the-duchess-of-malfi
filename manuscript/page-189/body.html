Kindle a little life in me.</p><p>BOSOLA.                      Are murder'd.</p><p>ANTONIO.  Some men have wish'd to die
At the hearing of sad tidings; I am glad
That I shall do 't in sadness. I would not now
Wish my wounds balm'd nor heal'd, for I have no use
To put my life to.  In all our quest of greatness,
Like wanton boys whose pastime is their care,
We follow after bubbles blown in th' air.
Pleasure of life, what is 't?  Only the good hours
Of an ague; merely a preparative to rest,
To endure vexation.  I do not ask
The process of my death; only commend me
To Delio.</p><p>BOSOLA.     Break, heart!</p><p>ANTONIO.  And let my son fly the courts to princes.
     [Dies.]</p><p>BOSOLA.  Thou seem'st to have lov'd Antonio.</p></div> </div>
