Are tears your justification?  The self-same tears
Will fall into your husband's bosom, lady,
With a loud protestation that you love him
Above the world.  Come, I 'll love you wisely,
That 's jealously; since I am very certain
You cannot make me cuckold.</p><p>JULIA.                       I 'll go home
To my husband.</p><p>CARDINAL.       You may thank me, lady,
I have taken you off your melancholy perch,
Bore you upon my fist, and show'd you game,
And let you fly at it.—I pray thee, kiss me.—
When thou wast with thy husband, thou wast watch'd
Like a tame elephant:—still you are to thank me:—
Thou hadst only kisses from him and high feeding;
But what delight was that?  'Twas just like one
That hath a little fing'ring on the lute,
Yet cannot tune it:—still you are to thank me.</p></div> </div>
