What devil art thou that counterfeit'st heaven's thunder?</p><p>BOSOLA.  Is that terrible?  I would have you tell me whether
Is that note worse that frights the silly birds
Out of the corn, or that which doth allure them
To the nets?  You have heark'ned to the last too much.</p><p>DUCHESS.  O misery! like to a rusty o'ercharg'd cannon,
Shall I never fly in pieces?—Come, to what prison?</p><p>BOSOLA.  To none.</p><p>DUCHESS.           Whither, then?</p><p>BOSOLA.                            To your palace.</p><p>DUCHESS.                                            I have heard
That Charon's boat serves to convey all o'er
The dismal lake, but brings none back again.</p></div> </div>
