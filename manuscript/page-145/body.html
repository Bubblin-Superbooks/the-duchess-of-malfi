With diamonds? or to be smothered
With cassia? or to be shot to death with pearls?
I know death hath ten thousand several doors
For men to take their exits; and 'tis found
They go on such strange geometrical hinges,
You may open them both ways:  any way, for heaven-sake,
So I were out of your whispering.  Tell my brothers
That I perceive death, now I am well awake,
Best gift is they can give or I can take.
I would fain put off my last woman's-fault,
I 'd not be tedious to you.</p><p>FIRST EXECUTIONER.           We are ready.</p><p>DUCHESS.  Dispose my breath how please you; but my body
Bestow upon my women, will you?</p><p>FIRST EXECUTIONER.               Yes.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">DUCHESS.  Pull, and pull strongly, for your able strength
Must pull down heaven upon me:â€”
Yet stay; heaven-gates are not so highly arch'd
As princes' palaces; they that enter there
Must go upon their knees</p></div> </div>
