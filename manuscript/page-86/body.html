 \[Enter\] DUCHESS, ANTONIO, and CARIOLA</code></pre><p>DUCHESS.  Bring me the casket hither, and the glass.—
You get no lodging here to-night, my lord.</p><p>ANTONIO.  Indeed, I must persuade one.</p><p>DUCHESS.                                Very good:
I hope in time 'twill grow into a custom,
That noblemen shall come with cap and knee
To purchase a night's lodging of their wives.</p><p>ANTONIO.  I must lie here.</p><p>DUCHESS.                    Must!  You are a lord of mis-rule.</p><p>ANTONIO.  Indeed, my rule is only in the night.</p><p>DUCHESS.  I 'll stop your mouth.
     [Kisses him.]</p><p>ANTONIO.  Nay, that 's but one; Venus had two soft doves
To draw her chariot; I must have another.—
     [She kisses him again.]
When wilt thou marry, Cariola?</p><p>CARIOLA.                        Never, my lord.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">ANTONIO.  O, fie upon this single life! forgo it.
