<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>DUCHESS.                  Pray, let 's hear it.</p><p>ANTONIO.  Say a man never marry, nor have children,
What takes that from him?  Only the bare name
Of being a father, or the weak delight
To see the little wanton ride a-cock-horse
Upon a painted stick, or hear him chatter
Like a taught starling.</p><p>DUCHESS.                 Fie, fie, what 's all this?
One of your eyes is blood-shot; use my ring to 't.
They say 'tis very sovereign.  'Twas my wedding-ring,
And I did vow never to part with it
But to my second husband.</p><p>ANTONIO.  You have parted with it now.</p><p>DUCHESS.  Yes, to help your eye-sight.</p><p>ANTONIO.  You have made me stark blind.</p><p>DUCHESS.  How?</p><p>ANTONIO.  There is a saucy and ambitious devil
Is dancing in this circle.</p><p>DUCHESS.                    Remove him.</p><p>ANTONIO.  How?</p></div> </div>
