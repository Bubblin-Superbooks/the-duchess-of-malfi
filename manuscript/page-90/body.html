<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>FERDINAND.                        Do not speak.</p><p>DUCHESS.  No, sir:
I will plant my soul in mine ears, to hear you.</p><p>FERDINAND.  O most imperfect light of human reason,
That mak'st [us] so unhappy to foresee
What we can least prevent!  Pursue thy wishes,
And glory in them:  there 's in shame no comfort
But to be past all bounds and sense of shame.</p><p>DUCHESS.  I pray, sir, hear me:  I am married.</p><p>FERDINAND.                                      So!</p><p>DUCHESS.  Happily, not to your liking:  but for that,
Alas, your shears do come untimely now
To clip the bird's wings that 's already flown!
Will you see my husband?</p><p>FERDINAND.                Yes, if I could change
Eyes with a basilisk.</p><p>DUCHESS.               Sure, you came hither
By his confederacy.</p></div> </div>
