In my last will I have not much to give:
A many hungry guests have fed upon me;
Thine will be a poor reversion.</p><p>CARIOLA.                         I will die with her.</p><p>DUCHESS.  I pray thee, look thou giv'st my little boy
Some syrup for his cold, and let the girl
Say her prayers ere she sleep.
     [Cariola is forced out by the Executioners.]
Now what you please:
What death?</p><p>BOSOLA.       Strangling; here are your executioners.</p><p>DUCHESS.  I forgive them:
The apoplexy, catarrh, or cough o' th' lungs,
Would do as much as they do.</p><p>BOSOLA.  Doth not death fright you?</p><p>DUCHESS.                             Who would be afraid on 't,
Knowing to meet such excellent company
In th' other world?</p><p>BOSOLA.  Yet, methinks,
The manner of your death should much afflict you:
This cord should terrify you.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">DUCHESS.                       Not a whit:
What would it pleasure me</p></div> </div>
