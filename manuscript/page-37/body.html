Keep poison from their children.</p><p>DUCHESS.                          Thy protestation
Is ingenious and hearty; I believe it.
Is Antonio come?</p><p>CARIOLA.          He attends you.</p><p>DUCHESS.                           Good dear soul,
Leave me; but place thyself behind the arras,
Where thou mayst overhear us.  Wish me good speed;
For I am going into a wilderness,
Where I shall find nor path nor friendly clue
To be my guide.
     [Cariola goes behind the arras.]
     [Enter ANTONIO]
                 I sent for you:  sit down;
Take pen and ink, and write:  are you ready?</p><p>ANTONIO.                                      Yes.</p><p>DUCHESS.  What did I say?</p><p>ANTONIO.  That I should write somewhat.</p><p>DUCHESS.                                 O, I remember.
After these triumphs and this large expense
It 's fit, like thrifty husbands, we inquire
What 's laid up for to-morrow.</p><p>ANTONIO.  So please your beauteous excellence.</p></div> </div>
