Will satisfy you no:  our Roman prelates
Do not keep lodging for ladies.</p><p>DELIO.                           Very well:
I have brought you no commendations from your husband,
For I know none by him.</p><p>JULIA.                   I hear he 's come to Rome.</p><p>DELIO.  I never knew man and beast, of a horse and a knight,
So weary of each other.  If he had had a good back,
He would have undertook to have borne his horse,
His breech was so pitifully sore.</p><p>JULIA.                             Your laughter
Is my pity.</p><p>DELIO.  Lady, I know not whether
You want money, but I have brought you some.</p><p>JULIA.  From my husband?</p><p>DELIO.                    No, from mine own allowance.</p><p>JULIA.  I must hear the condition, ere I be bound to take it.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">DELIO.  Look on 't, 'tis gold; hath it not a fine</p></div> </div>
