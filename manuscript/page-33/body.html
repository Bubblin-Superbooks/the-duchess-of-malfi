 \[Enter FERDINAND, DUCHESS, CARDINAL, and CARIOLA\]</code></pre><p>CARDINAL.  We are to part from you; and your own discretion
Must now be your director.</p><p>FERDINAND.                  You are a widow:
You know already what man is; and therefore
Let not youth, high promotion, eloquence——</p><p>CARDINAL.  No,
Nor anything without the addition, honour,
Sway your high blood.</p><p>FERDINAND.             Marry! they are most luxurious
Will wed twice.</p><p>CARDINAL.        O, fie!</p><p>FERDINAND.                Their livers are more spotted
Than Laban's sheep.</p><p>DUCHESS.              Diamonds are of most value,
They say, that have pass'd through most jewellers' hands.</p></div> </div>
