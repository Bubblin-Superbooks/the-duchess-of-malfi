in person.</p><p>FERDINAND.  Now for some gravity.â€”Why, my lord?</p><p>CASTRUCCIO.  It is fitting a soldier arise to be a prince, but not

This might take idle, offensive, and base office from him, whereas
the other deprives him of honour.</p><p>CASTRUCCIO.  Believe my experience, that realm is never long in quiet
where the ruler is a soldier.</p><p>FERDINAND.  Thou toldest me thy wife could not endure fighting.</p></div> </div>
