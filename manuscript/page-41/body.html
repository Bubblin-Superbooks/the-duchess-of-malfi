May do it:  thus.  Is it fit?
     [She puts the ring upon his finger]: he kneels.</p><p>ANTONIO.                       What said you?</p><p>DUCHESS.                                       Sir,
This goodly roof of yours is too low built;
I cannot stand upright in 't nor discourse,
Without I raise it higher.  Raise yourself;
Or, if you please, my hand to help you:  so.
     [Raises him.]</p><p>ANTONIO.  Ambition, madam, is a great man's madness,
That is not kept in chains and close-pent rooms,
But in fair lightsome lodgings, and is girt
With the wild noise of prattling visitants,
Which makes it lunatic beyond all cure.
Conceive not I am so stupid but I aim
Whereto your favours tend:  but he 's a fool
That, being a-cold, would thrust his hands i' the fire
To warm them.</p><p>DUCHESS.       So, now the ground 's broke,
You may discover what a wealthy mine
I make your lord of.</p></div> </div>
