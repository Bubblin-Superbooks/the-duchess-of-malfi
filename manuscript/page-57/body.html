<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>ANTONIO.  O my most trusty Delio, we are lost!
I fear she 's fall'n in labour; and there 's left
No time for her remove.</p><p>DELIO.                   Have you prepar'd
Those ladies to attend her; and procur'd
That politic safe conveyance for the midwife
Your duchess plotted?</p><p>ANTONIO.               I have.</p><p>DELIO.  Make use, then, of this forc'd occasion.
Give out that Bosola hath poison'd her
With these apricocks; that will give some colour
For her keeping close.</p><p>ANTONIO.                Fie, fie, the physicians
Will then flock to her.</p><p>DELIO.  For that you may pretend
She'll use some prepar'd antidote of her own,
Lest the physicians should re-poison her.</p><p>ANTONIO.  I am lost in amazement:  I know not what to think on 't.
     Exeunt.</p></div> </div>
