'Tis ceremony more than duty that consists
In the removing of a piece of felt.
Be you the example to the rest o' th' court;
Put on your hat first.</p><p>ANTONIO.                You must pardon me:
I have seen, in colder countries than in France,
Nobles stand bare to th' prince; and the distinction
Methought show'd reverently.</p><p>BOSOLA.  I have a present for your grace.</p><p>DUCHESS.                                   For me, sir?</p><p>BOSOLA.  Apricocks, madam.</p><p>DUCHESS.                    O, sir, where are they?
I have heard of none to-year</p><p>BOSOLA.  [Aside.]              Good; her colour rises.</p><p>DUCHESS.  Indeed, I thank you:  they are wondrous fair ones.
What an unskilful fellow is our gardener!
We shall have none this month.</p></div> </div>
