I am weary of her, and by any means
Would be quit of.</p><p>JULIA.             How now, my lord! what ails you?</p><p>CARDINAL.  Nothing.</p><p>JULIA.               O, you are much alter'd:
Come, I must be your secretary, and remove
This lead from off your bosom:  what 's the matter?</p><p>CARDINAL.  I may not tell you.</p><p>JULIA.  Are you so far in love with sorrow

These many winters, cannot be the same
Unto your tongue?</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">CARDINAL.          Satisfy thy longing,—
