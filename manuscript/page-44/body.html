<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">without this circumference
Is only to be pitied, and not fear'd:
Yet, should they know it, time will easily
Scatter the tempest.</p><p>ANTONIO.              These words should be mine,
And all the parts you have spoke, if some part of it
Would not have savour'd flattery.</p><p>DUCHESS.  Kneel.

I have heard lawyers say, a contract in a chamber
Per verba \ is absolute marriage.

Bless, heaven, this sacred gordian which let violence
Never untwine!</p><p>ANTONIO.  And may our sweet affections, like the spheres,
Be still in motion!</p><p>DUCHESS.             Quickening, and make
The like soft music!</p></div> </div>
