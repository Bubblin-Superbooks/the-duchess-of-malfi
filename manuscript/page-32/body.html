For the good deed you have done me, I must do
All the ill man can invent!  Thus the devil
Candies all sins o'er; and what heaven terms vile,
That names he complimental.</p><p>FERDINAND.                   Be yourself;
Keep your old garb of melancholy; 'twill express
You envy those that stand above your reach,
Yet strive not to come near 'em.  This will gain
Access to private lodgings, where yourself
May, like a politic dormouse——</p><p>BOSOLA.                         As I have seen some
Feed in a lord's dish, half asleep, not seeming
To listen to any talk; and yet these rogues
Have cut his throat in a dream.  What 's my place?
The provisorship o' the horse?  Say, then, my corruption
Grew out of horse-dung:  I am your creature.</p><p>FERDINAND.                                    Away!
     [Exit.]</p><p>BOSOLA.  Let good men, for good deeds, covet good fame,
Since place and riches oft are bribes of shame.
Sometimes the devil doth preach.
     [Exit.]</p></div> </div>
