He gave us these large wounds, as we were struggling
Here i' th' rushes.  And now, I pray, let me
Be laid by and never thought of.
     [Dies.]</p><p>PESCARA.  How fatally, it seems, he did withstand
His own rescue!</p><p>MALATESTI.       Thou wretched thing of blood,
How came Antonio by his death?</p><p>BOSOLA.  In a mist; I know not how:
Such a mistake as I have often seen
In a play.  O, I am gone!
We are only like dead walls or vaulted graves,
That, ruin'd, yield no echo.  Fare you well.
It may be pain, but no harm, to me to die
In so good a quarrel.  O, this gloomy world!
In what a shadow, or deep pit of darkness,
Doth womanish and fearful mankind live!
Let worthy minds ne'er stagger in distrust
To suffer death or shame for what is just:
Mine is another voyage.
     [Dies.]</p></div> </div>
