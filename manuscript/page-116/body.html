A politic equivocation!
He doth not want your counsel, but your head;
That is, he cannot sleep till you be dead.
And here 's another pitfall that 's strew'd o'er
With roses; mark it, 'tis a cunning one:
     [Reads.]
  'I stand engaged for your husband for several debts at Naples:
  let not that trouble him; I had rather have his heart than his
  money':â€”
And I believe so too.</p><p>BOSOLA.                What do you believe?</p><p>DUCHESS.  That he so much distrusts my husband's love,
He will by no means believe his heart is with him
Until he see it:  the devil is not cunning enough
To circumvent us In riddles.</p><p>BOSOLA.  Will you reject that noble and free league
Of amity and love which I present you?</p><p>DUCHESS.  Their league is like that of some politic kings,
Only to make themselves of strength and power
To be our after-ruin; tell them so.</p></div> </div>
