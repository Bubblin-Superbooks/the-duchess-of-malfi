<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">[Kneels].—Come, violent death,
Serve for mandragora to make me sleep!—
Go tell my brothers, when I am laid out,
They then may feed in quiet.
     They strangle her.</p><p>BOSOLA.  Where 's the waiting-woman??
Fetch her:  some other strangle the children.
     [Enter CARIOLA]
Look you, there sleeps your mistress.</p><p>CARIOLA.                               O, you are damn'd
Perpetually for this!  My turn is next;
Is 't not so ordered?</p><p>BOSOLA.                Yes, and I am glad
You are so well prepar'd for 't.</p><p>CARIOLA.                          You are deceiv'd, sir,
I am not prepar'd for 't, I will not die;
I will first come to my answer, and know
How I have offended.</p><p>BOSOLA.               Come, despatch her.—
You kept her counsel; now you shall keep ours.</p><p>CARIOLA.  I will not die, I must not; I am contracted
To a young gentleman.</p></div> </div>
