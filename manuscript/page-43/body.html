Make not your heart so dead a piece of flesh,
To fear more than to love me.  Sir, be confident:
What is 't distracts you?  This is flesh and blood, sir;
'Tis not the figure cut in alabaster
Kneels at my husband's tomb.  Awake, awake, man!
I do here put off all vain ceremony,
And only do appear to you a young widow
That claims you for her husband, and, like a widow,
I use but half a blush in 't.</p><p>ANTONIO.                       Truth speak for me;
I will remain the constant sanctuary
Of your good name.</p><p>DUCHESS.            I thank you, gentle love:
And 'cause you shall not come to me in debt,
Being now my steward, here upon your lips
I sign your Quietus est.  This you should have begg'd now.
I have seen children oft eat sweetmeats thus,
As fearful to devour them too soon.</p><p>ANTONIO.  But for your brothers?</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">DUCHESS.                          Do not think of them:
