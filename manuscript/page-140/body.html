fantastical puff-paste.  Our bodies are weaker than those paper-
prisons boys use to keep flies in; more contemptible, since ours
is to preserve earth-worms.  Didst thou ever see a lark in a cage?
Such is the soul in the body:  this world is like her little turf
of grass, and the heaven o'er our heads like her looking-glass, only
gives us a miserable knowledge of the small compass of our prison.</p><p>DUCHESS.  Am not I thy duchess?</p><p>BOSOLA.  Thou art some great woman, sure, for riot begins to sit
on thy forehead (clad in gray hairs) twenty years sooner than on
a merry milk-maid's.  Thou sleepest worse than if a mouse should be
forced to take up her lodging in a cat's ear:  a little infant that
breeds its teeth, should it lie with thee, would cry out, as if thou
wert the more unquiet bedfellow.</p><p>DUCHESS.  I am Duchess of Malfi still.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">BOSOLA.  That makes thy sleep so broken:
