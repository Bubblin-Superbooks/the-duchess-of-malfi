An intelligencer.</p><p>FERDINAND.          Such a kind of thriving thing

Which hell calls angels!  These curs'd gifts would make
You a corrupter, me an impudent traitor;
And should I take these, they'd take me [to] hell.</p><p>FERDINAND.  Sir, I 'll take nothing from you that I have given.
There is a place that I procur'd for you
This morning, the provisorship o' the horse;
Have you heard on 't?</p><p>BOSOLA.                No.</p><p>FERDINAND.                  'Tis yours:  is 't not worth thanks?</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">BOSOLA.  I would have you curse yourself now, that your bounty
(Which makes men truly noble) e'er should make me
A villain.  O, that to avoid</p></div> </div>
