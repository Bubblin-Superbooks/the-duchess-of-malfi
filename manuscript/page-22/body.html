should be my touch-wood, take fire when I give fire; that is,
laugh when I laugh, were the subject never so witty.</p><p>CASTRUCCIO.  True, my lord:  I myself have heard a very good jest,
and have scorn'd to seem to have so silly a wit as to understand it.</p><p>FERDINAND.  But I can laugh at your fool, my lord.</p><p>CASTRUCCIO.  He cannot speak, you know, but he makes faces; my lady
cannot abide him.</p><p>FERDINAND.  No?</p><p>CASTRUCCIO.  Nor endure to be in merry company; for she says too much
laughing, and too much company, fills her too full of the wrinkle.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">FERDINAND.  I would, then, have a mathematical instrument made
for her face, that she might not laugh</p></div> </div>
