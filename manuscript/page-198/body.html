Told me of Antonio's being here, and show'd me
A pretty gentleman, his son and heir.</p><pre><code> \[Enter DELIO, and ANTONIO'S Son\]</code></pre><p>MALATESTI.  O sir, you come too late!</p><p>DELIO.                                 I heard so, and
Was arm'd for 't, ere I came.  Let us make noble use
Of this great ruin; and join all our force
To establish this young hopeful gentleman
In 's mother's right.  These wretched eminent things
Leave no more fame behind 'em, than should one
Fall in a frost, and leave his print in snow;
As soon as the sun shines, it ever melts,
Both form and matter.  I have ever thought
Nature doth nothing so great for great men
As when she 's pleas'd to make them lords of truth:
Integrity of life is fame's best friend,
Which nobly, beyond death, shall crown the end.
     Exeunt.</p><p>FOOTNOTES:</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">[ Malfi. The presence-chamber in the palace of the</p></div> </div>
