His grace is very well recover'd.</p><p>MALATESTI.  Good my lord, suffer us.</p><p>CARDINAL.                             O, by no means;
The noise, and change of object in his eye,
Doth more distract him.  I pray, all to bed;
And though you hear him in his violent fit,
Do not rise, I entreat you.</p><p>PESCARA.  So, sir; we shall not.</p><p>CARDINAL.                         Nay, I must have you promise
Upon your honours, for I was enjoin'd to 't
By himself; and he seem'd to urge it sensibly.</p><p>PESCARA.  Let our honours bind this trifle.</p><p>CARDINAL.  Nor any of your followers.</p><p>MALATESTI.  Neither.</p><p>CARDINAL.  It may be, to make trial of your promise,
When he 's asleep, myself will rise and feign
Some of his mad tricks, and cry out for help,
And feign myself in danger.</p></div> </div>
