Be well advis'd, and think what danger 'tis
To receive a prince's secrets.  They that do,
Had need have their breasts hoop'd with adamant
To contain them.  I pray thee, yet be satisfi'd;
Examine thine own frailty; 'tis more easy
To tie knots than unloose them.  'Tis a secret
That, like a ling'ring poison, may chance lie
Spread in thy veins, and kill thee seven year hence.</p><p>JULIA.  Now you dally with me.</p><p>CARDINAL.                       No more; thou shalt know it.
By my appointment the great Duchess of Malfi
And two of her young children, four nights since,
Were strangl'd.</p><p>JULIA.           O heaven! sir, what have you done!</p><p>CARDINAL.  How now?  How settles this?  Think you your bosom
Will be a grave dark and obscure enough
For such a secret?</p><p>JULIA.              You have undone yourself, sir.</p></div> </div>
