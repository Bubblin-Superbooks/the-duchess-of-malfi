<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>BOSOLA.  Your brothers mean you safety and pity.</p><p>DUCHESS.                                          Pity!
With such a pity men preserve alive
Pheasants and quails, when they are not fat enough
To be eaten.</p><p>BOSOLA.  These are your children?</p><p>DUCHESS.                           Yes.</p><p>BOSOLA.                                  Can they prattle?</p><p>DUCHESS.  No:
But I intend, since they were born accurs'd,
Curses shall be their first language.</p><p>BOSOLA.                                Fie, madam!
Forget this base, low fellow——</p><p>DUCHESS.                          Were I a man,
I 'd beat that counterfeit face into thy other.</p><p>BOSOLA.  One of no birth.</p><p>DUCHESS.                   Say that he was born mean,
Man is most happy when 's own actions
Be arguments and examples of his virtue.</p><p>BOSOLA.  A barren, beggarly virtue.</p></div> </div>
