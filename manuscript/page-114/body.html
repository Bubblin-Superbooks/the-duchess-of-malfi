Lightens in great men's breath.</p><p>DUCHESS.                         Is all our train
Shrunk to this poor remainder?</p><p>ANTONIO.                        These poor men
Which have got little in your service, vow
To take your fortune:  but your wiser buntings,
Now they are fledg'd, are gone.</p><p>DUCHESS.                         They have done wisely.
This puts me in mind of death:  physicians thus,
With their hands full of money, use to give o'er
Their patients.</p><p>ANTONIO.         Right the fashion of the world:
]From decay'd fortunes every flatterer shrinks;
Men cease to build where the foundation sinks.</p><p>DUCHESS.  I had a very strange dream to-night.</p><p>ANTONIO.                                        What was 't?</p></div> </div>
