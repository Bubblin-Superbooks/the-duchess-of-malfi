I would have you give o'er these chargeable revels:
A visor and a mask are whispering-rooms
That were never built for goodness,—fare ye well—
And women like variety of courtship.
What cannot a neat knave with a smooth tale
Make a woman believe?  Farewell, lusty widow.

Lay in my way unto this marriage,
I 'd make them my low footsteps.  And even now,
Even in this hate, as men in some great battles,
By apprehending danger, have achiev'd
Almost impossible actions (I have heard soldiers say so),
So I through frights and threatenings will assay
This dangerous venture.  Let old wives report
I wink'd and chose a husband.—Cariola,
To thy known secrecy I have given up
More than my life,—my fame.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">CARIOLA.                      Both shall be safe;
For I 'll conceal this secret from the world
As warily as those that trade in</p></div> </div>
