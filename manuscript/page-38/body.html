<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>DUCHESS.                                        Beauteous!
Indeed, I thank you.  I look young for your sake;
You have ta'en my cares upon you.</p><p>ANTONIO.                           I 'll fetch your grace
The particulars of your revenue and expense.</p><p>DUCHESS.  O, you are
An upright treasurer:  but you mistook;
For when I said I meant to make inquiry
What 's laid up for to-morrow, I did mean
What 's laid up yonder for me.</p><p>ANTONIO.                        Where?</p><p>DUCHESS.                                In heaven.
I am making my will (as 'tis fit princes should,
In perfect memory), and, I pray, sir, tell me,
Were not one better make it smiling, thus,
Than in deep groans and terrible ghastly looks,
As if the gifts we parted with procur'd
That violent distraction?</p><p>ANTONIO.                   O, much better.</p><p>DUCHESS.  If I had a husband now, this care were quit:
But I intend to make you overseer.
What good deed shall we first remember?  Say.</p></div> </div>
