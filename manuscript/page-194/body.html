Rally the vaunt-guard, or the day is lost,
Yield, yield!  I give you the honour of arms
Shake my sword over you; will you yield?</p><p>CARDINAL.  Help me; I am your brother!</p><p>FERDINAND.                              The devil!
My brother fight upon the adverse party!
     He wounds the CARDINAL, and, in the scuffle, gives BOSOLA
     his death-wound.
There flies your ransom.</p><p>CARDINAL.  O justice!
I suffer now for what hath former bin:
Sorrow is held the eldest child of sin.</p></div> </div>
