For I am chain'd to endure all your tyranny.</p><pre><code> \[Enter Madman\]

 Here by a Madman this song is sung to a dismal kind of music</code></pre><p>O, let us howl some heavy note,
  Some deadly dogged howl,
Sounding as from the threatening throat
  Of beasts and fatal fowl!
As ravens, screech-owls, bulls, and bears,
  We 'll bell, and bawl our parts,
Till irksome noise have cloy'd your ears
  And corrosiv'd your hearts.
At last, whenas our choir wants breath,
  Our bodies being blest,
We 'll sing, like swans, to welcome death,
  And die in love and rest.</p><p>FIRST MADMAN.  Doom's-day not come yet!  I 'll draw it nearer by
a perspective, or make a glass that shall set all the world
on fire upon an instant.  I cannot sleep; my pillow is stuffed
with a litter of porcupines.</p></div> </div>
