That I must be committed on pretence
Of poisoning her; which I 'll endure, and laugh at.
If one could find the father now! but that
Time will discover.  Old Castruccio
I' th' morning posts to Rome:  by him I 'll send
A letter that shall make her brothers' galls
O'erflow their livers.  This was a thrifty way!
Though lust do mask in ne'er so strange disguise,
She 's oft found witty, but is never wise.
