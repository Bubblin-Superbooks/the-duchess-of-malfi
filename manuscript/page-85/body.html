He that can compass me, and know my drifts,
May say he hath put a girdle 'bout the world,
And sounded all her quick-sands.</p><p>BOSOLA.                           I do not
Think so.</p><p>FERDINAND.  What do you think, then, pray?</p><p>BOSOLA.                                     That you
Are your own chronicle too much, and grossly
Flatter yourself.</p><p>FERDINAND.         Give me thy hand; I thank thee:
I never gave pension but to flatterers,
Till I entertained thee.  Farewell.
That friend a great man's ruin strongly checks,
Who rails into his belief all his defects.
     Exeunt.</p></div> </div>
