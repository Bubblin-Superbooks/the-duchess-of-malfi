This dark'ning of your worth is not like that
Which tradesmen use i' the city; their false lights
Are to rid bad wares off:  and I must tell you,
If you will know where breathes a complete man
(I speak it without flattery), turn your eyes,
And progress through yourself.</p><p>ANTONIO.  Were there nor heaven nor hell,
I should be honest:  I have long serv'd virtue,
And ne'er ta'en wages of her.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">DUCHESS.                       Now she pays it.
The misery of us that are born great!
We are forc'd to woo, because none dare woo us;
And as a tyrant doubles with his words,
And fearfully equivocates, so we
Are forc'd to express our violent passions
In riddles and in dreams, and leave the path
Of simple virtue, which was never made
To seem the thing it is not.  Go, go brag
You have left me heartless; mine is in your bosom:
I hope 'twill multiply</p></div> </div>
