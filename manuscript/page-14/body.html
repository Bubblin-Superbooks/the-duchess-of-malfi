You have been long in France, and you return
A very formal Frenchman in your habit:
How do you like the French court?</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">ANTONIO.                          I admire it:
In seeking to reduce both state and people
To a fix'd order, their judicious king
Begins at home; quits first his royal palace
Of flattering sycophants, of dissolute
And infamous persons,â€”which he sweetly terms
His master's master-piece, the work of heaven;
Considering duly that a prince's court
Is like a common fountain, whence should flow
Pure silver drops in general, but if 't chance
Some curs'd example poison 't near the head,
Death and diseases</p></div> </div>
