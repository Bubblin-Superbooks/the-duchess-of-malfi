<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">in love with such a face else?
I have already suffer'd for thee so much pain,
The only remedy to do me good
Is to kill my longing.</p><p>BOSOLA.                 Sure, your pistol holds
Nothing but perfumes or kissing-comfits.
Excellent lady!
You have a pretty way on 't to discover
Your longing.  Come, come, I 'll disarm you,
And arm you thus:  yet this is wondrous strange.</p><p>JULIA.  Compare thy form and my eyes together,
You 'll find my love no such great miracle.
Now you 'll say
I am wanton:  this nice modesty in ladies
Is but a troublesome familiar
That haunts them.</p><p>BOSOLA.  Know you me, I am a blunt soldier.</p><p>JULIA.                                       The better:
Sure, there wants fire where there are no lively sparks
Of roughness.</p><p>BOSOLA.  And I want compliment.</p><p>JULIA.                           Why, ignorance
In courtship cannot make you do amiss,
If you have a heart to do well.</p></div> </div>
