<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">Pope was sick
Of a deep melancholy, presented him
With several sorts of madmen, which wild object
Being full of change and sport, forc'd him to laugh,
And so the imposthume broke:  the self-same cure
The duke intends on you.</p><p>DUCHESS.                  Let them come in.</p><p>SERVANT.  There 's a mad lawyer; and a secular priest;
A doctor that hath forfeited his wits
By jealousy; an astrologian
That in his works said such a day o' the month
Should be the day of doom, and, failing of 't,
Ran mad; an English tailor craz'd i' the brain
With the study of new fashions; a gentleman-usher
Quite beside himself with care to keep in mind
The number of his lady's salutations
Or 'How do you,' she employ'd him in each morning;
A farmer, too, an excellent knave in grain,
Mad 'cause he was hind'red transportation:
And let one broker that 's mad loose to these,
You'd think the devil were among them.</p></div> </div>
