For a notorious murder; and 'twas thought
The cardinal suborn'd it:  he was releas'd
By the French general, Gaston de Foix,
When he recover'd Naples.</p><p>ANTONIO.                  'Tis great pity
He should be thus neglected:  I have heard
He 's very valiant.  This foul melancholy
Will poison all his goodness; for, I 'll tell you,
If too immoderate sleep be truly said
To be an inward rust unto the soul,
If then doth follow want of action
Breeds all black malcontents; and their close rearing,
Like moths in cloth, do hurt for want of wearing.</p></div> </div>
