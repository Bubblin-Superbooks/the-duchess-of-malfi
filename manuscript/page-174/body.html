Draw it from you:  it is an equal fault,
To tell one's secrets unto all or none.</p><p>CARDINAL.  The first argues folly.</p><p>JULIA.  But the last tyranny.</p><p>CARDINAL.  Very well:  why, imagine I have committed
Some secret deed which I desire the world
May never hear of.</p><p>JULIA.              Therefore may not I know it?
You have conceal'd for me as great a sin
As adultery.  Sir, never was occasion
For perfect trial of my constancy
Till now:  sir, I beseech you——</p><p>CARDINAL.                           You 'll repent it.</p></div> </div>
