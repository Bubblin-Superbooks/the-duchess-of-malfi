That seems to strike at me.
     [Enter BOSOLA, and Servant bearing ANTONIO'S body]
                             Now, art thou come?
Thou look'st ghastly;
There sits in thy face some great determination
Mix'd with some fear.</p><p>BOSOLA.                Thus it lightens into action:
I am come to kill thee.</p><p>CARDINAL.                Ha!â€”Help! our guard!</p><p>BOSOLA.  Thou art deceiv'd; they are out of thy howling.</p><p>CARDINAL.  Hold; and I will faithfully divide
Revenues with thee.</p><p>BOSOLA.              Thy prayers and proffers
Are both unseasonable.</p><p>CARDINAL.               Raise the watch!
We are betray'd!</p><p>BOSOLA.           I have confin'd your flight:
I 'll suffer your retreat to Julia's chamber,
But no further.</p><p>CARDINAL.        Help! we are betray'd!</p><pre class="  "><code> \[Enter, above, PESCARA, MALATESTI,</pre></div> </div>
