<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>BOSOLA.                  'Twas to bring you
By degrees to mortification.  Listen.</p><p>Hark, now everything is still,
  The screech-owl and the whistler shrill
  Call upon our dame aloud,
  And bid her quickly don her shroud!
  Much you had of land and rent;
  Your length in clay 's now competent:
  A long war disturb'd your mind;
  Here your perfect peace is sign'd.
  Of what is 't fools make such vain keeping?
  Sin their conception, their birth weeping,
  Their life a general mist of error,
  Their death a hideous storm of terror.
  Strew your hair with powders sweet,
  Don clean linen, bathe your feet,
  And (the foul fiend more to check)
  A crucifix let bless your neck.
  'Tis now full tide 'tween night and day;
  End your groan, and come away.</p><p>CARIOLA.  Hence, villains, tyrants, murderers! Alas!
What will you do with my lady?â€”Call for help!</p><p>DUCHESS.  To whom?  To our next neighbours?  They are mad-folks.</p></div> </div>
