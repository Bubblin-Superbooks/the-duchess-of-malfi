<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">almost dead example
Of a loving wife.</p><p>BOSOLA.            O, fie! despair?  Remember
You are a Christian.</p><p>DUCHESS.              The church enjoins fasting:
I 'll starve myself to death.</p><p>BOSOLA.                        Leave this vain sorrow.
Things being at the worst begin to mend:  the bee
When he hath shot his sting into your hand,
May then play with your eye-lid.</p><p>DUCHESS.                          Good comfortable fellow,
Persuade a wretch that 's broke upon the wheel
To have all his bones new set; entreat him live
To be executed again.  Who must despatch me?
I account this world a tedious theatre,
For I do play a part in 't 'gainst my will.</p><p>BOSOLA.  Come, be of comfort; I will save your life.</p><p>DUCHESS.  Indeed, I have not leisure to tend so small a business.</p><p>BOSOLA.  Now, by my life, I pity you.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">DUCHESS.                               Thou art a fool, then,
To waste thy pity</p></div> </div>
