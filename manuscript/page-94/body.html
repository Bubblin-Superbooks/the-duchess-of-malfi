Betray'd.  How came he hither?  I should turn

That you have cleft my heart, you shall read there
Mine innocence.</p><p>DUCHESS.         That gallery gave him entrance.</p><p>ANTONIO.  I would this terrible thing would come again,
That, standing on my guard, I might relate
My warrantable love.â€”

You would use it on yourself.</p><p>DUCHESS.                       His action seem'd

As well as a point:  turn it towards him, and
So fasten the keen edge in his rank gall.
