to any rank swelling use to cut off their tails, that the blood
may run through them the faster:  let me have no train when I go
to shed blood, less it make me have a greater when I ride
to the gallows.</p><p>CARDINAL.  Come to me after midnight, to help to remove
That body to her own lodging.  I 'll give out
She died o' th' plague; 'twill breed the less inquiry
After her death.</p><p>BOSOLA.  Where 's Castruccio her husband?</p><p>CARDINAL.  He 's rode to Naples, to take possession
Of Antonio's citadel.</p><p>BOSOLA.  Believe me, you have done a very happy turn.</p><p>CARDINAL.  Fail not to come.  There is the master-key
Of our lodgings; and by that you may conceive
What trust I plant in you.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">BOSOLA.                     You shall find me ready.
